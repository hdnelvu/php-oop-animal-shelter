# Animal Shelter üêï‚Äçü¶∫

Welcome to my animal shelter project, built using PHP and utilizing object-oriented programming principles. This project allows users to browse the status of the shelter, add new pet houses/animals to the shelter and manage the staff and volunteers at the shelter. Users can also add adopters and allow them to adopt animals. 

Created as a school project.


## Features

- Animal Management: Allows users to view, add, and update information about the animals in the animal shelter.
- Pet Houses Management: Allows users to view informations about the pet houses in the animal shelter.
- Employee and Volunteer Management: Allows users to view, add, and update information about the employees and volunteers.
- Adoption Management: Allows users to add and update information about adopters, as well as manage the adoption process.
